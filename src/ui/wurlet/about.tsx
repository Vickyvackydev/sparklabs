          Wurlet is a platform that helps users build, manage, and share their
          digital footprint â€” on their own terms. Whether showcasing
          professional achievements or personal milestones, users have the power
          to decide what to reveal and what to keep private. Our role was to
          create a clear, cohesive visual system that matched this core idea of
          empowered identity sharing, beginning with a detailed brand style
          guide and extending to practical brand collaterals.
